 * Each disk drive contains some number of file systems.
 * A file system consists of a number of cylinder groups.
 * Each cylinder group has inodes and data.
 *
 * A file system is described by its super-block, which in turn
 * describes the cylinder groups.  The super-block is critical
 * data and is replicated in each cylinder group to protect against
 * catastrophic loss.  This is done at `newfs' time and the critical
 * super-block data does not change, so the copies need not be
 * referenced further unless disaster strikes.
 *
 * The first boot and super blocks are given in absolute disk addresses.
 * The byte-offset forms are preferred, as they don't imply a sector size.
